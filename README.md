# Test Prepare / Prepack Lifecycle Scripts with Npm & Yarn

Simple repo to test which lifecycle scripts are run when using `npm`, `yarn`, and `pnpm` to install/setup this package in various ways.

## Results

These are the results manually extracted from [the logs](https://github.com/cinderblock/test-npm-yarn-lifecycle-scripts/actions).

### Questions

1. Why does `npm install <url>` run the `prepare` script twice?
1. Why does `npm pack` run both scripts, but the `prepare` script's output is never printed?
1. Why doesn't `pnpm` respect `.npmignore`&`package.json#files` field?
1. Why is `pnpm` a different order than `npm`?
1. **Which script(s) should be set so that a package can be consistently installed and setup in all package managers?**
